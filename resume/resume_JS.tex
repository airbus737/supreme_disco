The nature of my education and work experience has prepared me for a position at your company. It has involved a great deal of personal developement, formal education, self-motivation and a wide range of employement experiences. My previous position at ForeFlight allowed me to expand my skill set with aviation, GIS, python and database management. 

Prior to that I was the Operations Supervisor managing at team of 25 employees following all applicable federal, state, and FAA regulations. In my time as the station Supervisor I expanded my customer service, attention to detail, and time managment skills which I feel have made me a well rounded employee for any company.

I am able to learn new techniques and procedures quickly and efficiently and have a keen eye for detail and I enjoy staying up-to-date with my knowledge. I am able to take on the responsibility of this position immediately, and have the enthusiasm and determination to ensure that I make a success of it.

Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
